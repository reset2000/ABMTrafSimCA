ABMTraf\+Sim\+CA is a Windows desktop application written in C++ with a user interface implemented with the Qt library. It contains all the basic functions which are necessary to carry out traffic modelling and simulation based on the CA model. The developed software enables users to adapt the system to their needs freely and allows the observation of the traffic phenomenon through two types of diagrams (space-\/time and fundamental diagrams). Such diagrams are the most expected by researchers dealing with the indicated topics. The implemented model serves a straight, two-\/lane road with a determined density of vehicles and periodic boundary conditions. Thanks to that, a constant percentage of occupied CA cells during the simulation is maintained. \hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Simulating traffic based on parameters set by the user.
\item Creating agents (driver profiles) with certain simulation properties.
\item Creating sets of parameters for road such as length, number of cycles, diagram parameters etc.
\item Customisation of desirable car lengths to achieve more realistic simulations.
\item Implementation of a traffic model enabling realistic acceleration and braking of vehicles, including a safe distance and emergency braking.
\item Space-\/time diagrams allow users to see the results of a single simulation iteration with a specific density for each lane separately.
\item Fundamental diagrams allow users to see the flow of cars for set densities based on data averaged from multiple simulations.
\item Storage of generated diagrams and sets of parameters in the database for later use.
\item Customisation of display styles for space-\/time and fundamental diagrams.

To use the application on Windows operating system, first you needs to download the repository from this Git\+Hub page.



After the repository is downoaded, the executable package can be found in "{}\+Executable"{} folder.



Inside the "{}\+Executable"{} folder there is a .zip file that needs to be unpacked first.



After you unpack the .zip file, open the ABMTraf\+Sim\+CA\+\_\+executable folder and click on the Traffic\+Simulator.\+exe file to launch the application.



The main window of the application should appear.

\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{How to run the project}{How to run the project}}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
The project should be run through Qt Creator (version 10.\+0.\+0+). The software can be downloaded from the official Qt Group website avaliable under \href{https://www.qt.io/download}{\texttt{ THIS}} adress.



The installation process should be followed as intructed by the Qt Creator installer directions.

Before you can launch the application, you need to download this repository from Github\+:



After this, it is necessary to unpack the .zip file.

To launch the application, the user should click “\+Open Project” button in Qt Creator.



Then choose “\+CMake\+Lists.\+txt” file from the downloaded and unpacked repository.



After opening the project, choose the correct configuration (Min\+GW)\+:



Change the build configuration of the project to "{}\+Release"{}\+:



The user should run the application using “\+Run” button (or Ctrl + R shortcut on Windows).



After running the programm through Qt Creator, the main window of the application should appear.
